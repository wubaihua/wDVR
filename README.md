## Introduction

wDVR is a DVR program for 1-dim multi electronic state quantum system to solve the eigen equation and compute the time evolution of the system.





## Features Currently Implemented

* finite DVR





## Supported Test Model

* Harmonic oscillator
* Quadruple oscillator
* 2-state dual harmonic oscillator
* 3-state morse potential



## TODO

* Tully model
* sine-DVR
* compute the thermal equilibrium correlation function
